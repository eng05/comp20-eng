# comp20-eng

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?
The purpose of this Git repository is to serve as a storage location for all assignments and labs that I completed for my COMP20 Web Programming class in Spring 2015.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was Assignment 2 Marauder’s Map because I learned how to use the Google Maps API, the JSON API, and the geolocation API, which are all very useful for future application development. It is also a very cool assignment to show friends and family and can be very easily improved on for future use.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I definitely grew a lot since day 1 of the course since I had not taken a computer science course since Spring 2012 and knew nothing about web development. After taking this course, I learned a lot more about what front-end and back-end development actually means, much more about how websites are designed nowadays, tools to facilitate development, and the security risks involved.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing that I learned in this course was the web security aspect of it. I never really understood how hackers collected private information or broke down servers, and I now have a much better understanding. One example was trying to hack another classmate’s Maruader’s Map and server for assignment 4 and successfully launching a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Another example was successfully bypassing restrictions on input choices in the professor’s hackme.php example using Tamper Data.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve more into mobile development, especially given its increasing importance. I would also like to learn more about SQL databases because I will be coding in SQL to query through databases as part of my job after graduation.
